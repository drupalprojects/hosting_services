Installation:
Installation is simple, you will need to place this into the modules folder like any other
module.  Enable it.  You will need to use Services API 2.2 with this module in order for it to
work.  Follow the instructions for Installing Services API.  Additionally it is HIGHLY recommended
that you enable and use both API keys, and Session ID as a part of using this module.  You should also implement
the Permissions system when using this module.  You should only enable actions that you feel a perticular api key needs.

This is a server side module only, should be installed on an Aegir site.

Client Side modules should look to the included example at how to accomplish things. My example will be
of an XMLRPC client, but you can use any of the supported Services API servers with this module.
